#OSINT Research Report

Selected OSINT Tools & Integration Plan
1. Shodan
Purpose: Detects exposed services and vulnerabilities.
Integration: Use API to scan IP addresses and ports for potential risks.

2. Have I Been Pwned (HIBP)
Purpose: Identifies compromised credentials.
Integration: API queries to check user emails against breach databases.

3. VirusTotal
Purpose: Provides malware and domain reputation analysis.
Integration: Submit URLs, files, and hashes for threat assessment.

4. Censys
Purpose: Internet-wide scan data for infrastructure security.
Integration: API queries for certificate transparency logs and open ports.

API Access Methods
Each API requires an access key, configured securely within the backend.
Calls will be made asynchronously to minimize performance impact.
Rate limits will be considered to avoid API restrictions.
These OSINT tools will enhance the RTTI systemâ€™s ability to detect, analyze, and respond to threats in real time.
